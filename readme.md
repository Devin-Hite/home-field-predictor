Problem Statement:
Can I serve betting companies by provinding a homefield-advantage prediction that is above 50%?

My first goal was to prove that homefield advantage exists using data for the English Premier League, particularly regarding Liverpool. The homefield advantage is hard to pin down, it is a subjective idea, the idea that a team performs better at home. The reasoning is often attirbuted to the home crowd. How would you perform if you had ~60,000 people jeering you, and cheering when the home team had the ball. 

I am trying to improve on a categorical target variable of winning or losing at home, the baseline accuracy is 50%. I intended to improve on that prediction, and achieve a model performance above 50% accuracy. (model info here). I provided several statistics related to English Premier League soccer home and away data. My statistics show that more wins were achieved at home for all teams across the league. Futhermore, I showed that the first-place team and the last-place team both won more games at home on average, having only won more away games twice between both places over the past 9 years. In addition, I wanted to look at performance by teams at home. I showed that both the first and last place teams scored more goals at home. Again, having only two anomalies between both first and last-place teams in the past 9 years.
